How do you set up a script to run every time a repository receives new commits through push?
	cd .git/hooks/
	vi pre-push
	Write the script in above file
	chmod +x pre-push

How do you find a list of files that have changed in a particular commit?
	git show --name-only <commit_id>


Monitor a log file, detect a pattern detection, send an email on detection
Please check shell script monit.sh

Monitor process particular process on an instance, send an email on incase of state change like process got stopped, taking more CPU that threshold
Please check python script monit_process.py


Create a sample docker container with a Node.js Express app and demonstrate the installation.
Guidelines :
● You should be able to find what system packages are needed by looking through the app
● You should not need to change the app code in any way
● The app should be running as a non-privileged user
  -> add a non root user to Dockerfile switch to that user
● The app should be automatically restarted if crashes or is killed
  -> set the --restart=always while running container 
● The app should maximize all of the available CPUs
  -> pass --cpus option while running the container
● Timezone should be in IST
  -> install tzdata, set TZ env variable to required timezone (ASIA/KOLKATA for IST)
  -> add soft linking as below
     RUN ln -snf /usr/share/zoneinfo/$TZ /etc/localtime && echo $TZ > /etc/timezone
● Follow best practices when writing a dockerfile

Please check the Dockerfile and musician-app nodejs application


1. Show how to block ports
sudo iptables -D OUTPUT -o eth0 -p tcp --dport 80 -j DROP

2. Show how to setup port forwarding
sudo iptables -A PREROUTING -t nat -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080
